# In Ruby three dots in an array.length loop mean one less -1 => 0...array.length
# for i in 0...array.length
#     puts array[i]
# end

# Functional programming and blocks (essentially a callback)
# do |arguments|
#     # do something
# end

# Another example of blocks
# numbers = [1, 2, 3]
# numbers.each {|x| puts(x + 1)}
# returns 2, 3, 4 and [1, 2, 4]

# Loops in Ruby
# 1 for loops
#     for i in 0..5
#         puts
#     end
# => 0 1 2 3 4 5

# 2 while loops
# i = 0
# while i <= 5
#     puts i
#     i += 1
# end
# => 0 1 2 3 4 5

# 3 until loops
# i = 0
# until i > 5
#     puts i
#     i += 1
# end
# => 0 1 2 3 4 5

# 4 upto() method using a block
# 0.upto(5) do |i|
#     puts i
# end
# => 0 1 2 3 4 5

# 5 times is another loop method (there are more ways to loop in Ruby)
# 3.times do
#     puts "Yay!"
# end
# => Yay! Yay! Yay!

# Case and Ranges in Ruby are very useful
# case distance
# when (1..3)
#     category= "Walking distance"
# when (4..10)
#     category= "Short trip"
# else
#     category= "Long trip"
# end
# => case statements in Ruby can allow ranges

# More ways to deal with exeptions in Ruby Error Management
# begin # login function that can raise an exeption or error
#     login()
# rescue UnknownUsernameError => e # this will raise a unknown username error the e will store the typed username
#     log(e)
#     raise e
# else # if there is no error it says Welcome back
#     puts "Welcome Back!"
# ensure # this is a cleanup code if there was an error it reloads the login screen
#     log("User login")
# end
